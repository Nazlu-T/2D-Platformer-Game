 Welcome to the WOFTMB repository! This game was created as part of my journey to teach myself Unity and C#. It showcases key features of platformer games, combining engaging gameplay mechanics with efficient code design.

 ðŸŽ® Game Overview

This project is a 2D platformer where players navigate through various levels, avoiding hazards, climbing ladders, and defeating enemies. The game features:

Player Controls: Run, jump, climb, and shoot with responsive mechanics.

Shooting System: Fire projectiles that interact with enemies and obstacles.

Level Progression: Progress through multiple levels with a seamless transition.

Score and Lives System: Keep track of player lives and score dynamically.

Hazard Interaction: Detect and respond to collisions with enemies and hazards.

Persistence: Maintain game state across levels using DontDestroyOnLoad.


ðŸ§  What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

Implementing platformer mechanics in Unity.

Using C# to script game behaviors.

Creating shooting mechanics with responsive player controls.

Managing game state and persistence across scenes.

Debugging and improving gameplay flow.

Understanding the Unity lifecycle methods and input systems.
